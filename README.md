# Offline map playground

An experiment in storing and displaying custom vector tiles from IndexedDB (using [level-js](https://github.com/maxogden/level.js)).

Work in progress

## Demo

[http://npeihl.com/offline-maps-playground](http://npeihl.com/offline-maps-playground)

Click the checkmark button to save map layers into IndexedDB. When complete the layers should display on the map. The map layers persist even after reload and in an offline state.

You can refresh the cache again later while online by clicking the checkmark button again.
